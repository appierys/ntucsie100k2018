["In 3 years, student who gratudated from NTU CSIE will have a base monthly salary more than 100 thousands NTD"](http://mrjamie.cc/2015/05/20/cs-crunch/) said [Mr. Jamie](http://mrjamie.cc/about/), in 2015. 


After almost 3 years, now is 2018. Let's countdown to the deadline that Mr. Jamie assigned, **May 20, 2018**, (more specific, **12:28 pm on May 20, 2018 UTC+8**, the time of [first comment on the article](http://mrjamie.cc/2015/05/20/cs-crunch/#comment-2035098957)) and ask, [NTU CSIE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) alumuns, what's your current salary?

Is it higher than **100 thousands** a month?

#It's 2018 now. Is your monthly salary higher than 100K?
